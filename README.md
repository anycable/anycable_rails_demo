## Installation

This app has a Docker-first configuration based one the [Ruby on Whales post](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/ruby-on-whales-docker-for-ruby-rails-development).

You need:

- `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

For MacOS just use [official app](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/).

- [`dip`](https://github.com/bibendi/dip) installed.

Run the following command to build images and provision the application:

```sh
dip provision
```

## Running

You can start Rails server along with AnyCable by running:

```sh
dip up rails anycable
```

Then go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and see the application in action.

## Debugging

If you want to run Rails server and/or with debugging capabilites, run the following commands:

```sh
# for Rails server
dip rails s

# for AnyCable
dip anycable
```

## Testing

We separate unit and system specs and provide convenient Dip commands to run them:

```sh
# only unit tests
dip rspec

# only system tests
dip rspec system
```

## Instrumentation

You can also collect and visualize instrumentation metrics via Prometheus and Grafana:

```sh
# Start Prometheus, Grafana and Cadvisor
dip up -d grafana
```

Open Grafana at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/) (login `admin`, password `admin`) and navigate to Dashboards → Manage.

Or just open dashboards using the direct links:
