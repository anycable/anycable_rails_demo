## Installation

This branch has a minimal number of dependencies to make it easier to run the project locally: SQLite instead of Postgres, no Redis, no Docker.

You need Ruby and NodeJS installed on your local machine (and maybe some common system deps for such gems as nokogiri and sqlite3).

```sh
bundle install
yarn install
bin/setup
```

## Running

Run Rails server and all secondary processes (CSS/JS bundling):

```sh
bin/dev
```

Then go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and see the application in action.

## Testing

We use RSpec for testing:

```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

**NOTE:** System tests require Chrome browser to be installed on your machine (no other software required).
